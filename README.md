# responsive_gallery
Test app for making a responsive web app with polymer, app engine endpoints and cloudstore to make a responsive web app that displays a gallery


Will expand this once it works. For now it does some things. Not worth explaining, but if you're looking for a demo of 
Cloud Endpoints Python + Polymer then I guess this is the place for a simple example.

Will be integrating cloudstore soon.
